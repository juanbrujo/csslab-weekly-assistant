# CSSLab Weekly Assistant

**NodeJS robot that helps me to build CSSLab's weekly newsletter**

> under development

This NodeJS script (by now) helps me to build the [CSSLab Weekly Newsletter](http://www.csslab.cl/csslab-weekly/) that takes me at least 2 hors of my time. 

So I'm automating some things and some of them is being added to this ðŸ¤– Assistant.

- **v0.0.1**: scrapes a list of sites (*.js array*) and get title, description and screenshot of each one of them. Saves them to a specific folder.

### TO-DO:

- ask for new directory and use it to save new files (inquirer)
- better callbacks.

### LICENSE:
